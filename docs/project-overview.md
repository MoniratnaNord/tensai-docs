**TensaiKit Agent Kit - Autonomous DeFAI Agent Kit on Katana** designed to enable fully autonomous AI agents to independently plan and execute financial operations on the **Katana Network**. This platform will serve as the foundational layer for AI-driven financial automation, marking a new chapter in the intersection of **Katana Network and intelligent automation**.

By integrating **TensaiKit- Autonomous DeFAI Agent Kit on Katana** with existing AI frameworks such as **ElizaOS** and **Langchain**, AI developers will gain access to a powerful infrastructure that allows seamless interaction with leading DeFi protocols on Katana. This will empower AI agents to execute on-chain operations, optimize strategies, and participate in autonomous trading and financial decision-making without human intervention
