### The Need for AI-Driven DeFi

As AI agents evolve, they require financial autonomy to interact with DeFi protocols efficiently. However, current DeFi infrastructures lack native support for AI-driven automation, making it difficult for AI agents to seamlessly execute transactions, optimize yield strategies, and manage on-chain assets without external intervention.

### Gaps in the Current Landscape

- **Limited AI integration in DeFi**: AI agents need structured tools to interact with DeFi protocols autonomously.
- **Fragmented DeFi protocols**: No unified agent kit exists to connect AI agents with multiple Katana-based protocols.
- **Lack of automated AI-driven financial operations**: AI agents currently struggle with on-chain financial decision-making
